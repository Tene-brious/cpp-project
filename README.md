This was a little project I had to do for a class during my Cybersecurity code that had some complexitiy (at least for me at the time) which included numerous verifications, obligatory functions as refilling the stock, being able to track the client number, show past 10 transactions and so on. I had some very one-on-one intense sessions with my dear girlfriend that helped me optimize the code, because initially I had everything "hard-coded" with no functions whatsoever that led me to having a very long code for no good reason.
One of the things that I am probably missing but it was not a requirement was adding a new (possible) fruit to the equation and a small-check to the stock adding function that I believe still lets you add a negative ammount. Coming from a pure routing and switching background, this was my pinnacle project that I was proud of. Leaving it here to document.
Note: Most of the comments I had were in Portuguese but I tried my best to translate or make whoever reads it understand why and what is on the code itself.
